## Goal
Our goal for making this robot was to increase the amount of oxygen and food on our planet. Why? It’s because we humans have done too much deforestation, causing animals to lose their homes, decrease the amount of oxygen we have to breathe, and it even has shortened the number of healthy food & crops for us humans, to eat.

## Rundown
The robot will be placed on a way of farmland, then it will go and plant seeds that can be either trees or crops. It will dig into the soil and plant the seed. Then it will move and repeat the process. After that it will conceal the dirt. Keep in mind this is just a prototype, and manual stopping will be required if this prototype is ever to be used in the real world.

## SeedSPit Technology
SeedSPit Technology is the technology our robot uses to drop seeds into the ground. This works with two cylinders, one outside the seeds, and one with the seeds and servo. If the servo rotates, it will drop seeds from both holes in the same location. If it rotates again, the inside hole will be moved away from the outside hole, blocking the seeds from dropping. To insert more seeds, turn off the robot, lift the hinge UP, and manually insert seeds into the hole using a funnel.
